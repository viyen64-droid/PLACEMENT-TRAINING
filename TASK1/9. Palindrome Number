Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

CODE:

class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int rev=0;
        int temp=x;
        while(temp>0){
            int rem=temp%10;
            rev=rev*10+rem;
            temp/=10;
        }
        if(rev==x)return true;
        return false;
    }
}
